'''ScalaCraft Domain''' is a collection of case classes covering a variety of common data types.

The data types are split across two variations,

 - Constrained
 - Unconstrained

Unconstrained versions of a data type generally have few restrictions imposed. This
is useful for capturing data that may require further validation before it can be trusted.

In contrast constrained versions enforce checks appropriate for the data type prior to construction
which means instances can be relied on to have a known level of correctness.

For example an unconstrained `IP6Address` can have any number of fields while a constrained `IP6Address`
will always have eight fields.
